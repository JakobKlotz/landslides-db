# Austrian Landslide Inventory

This project aims to build the most comprehensive, open-source landslide 
data base for Austria. The data base encompasses different mass movement 
phenomena (see [Classifications](#classifications) for more info).

By consolidating data from various national and international sources, we 
provide a PostGIS database that can be easily setup using Docker.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is under active development. The database schema and its records
> are subject to change.

> [!TIP]
> For quick access without setting up the data base, a GeoPackage dump is 
> available. It contains a single table of the events and is located in the
> [`db-dump/`](./db-dump/) directory.

## Getting Started

To get your own instance of the database up and running, please follow the 
setup instructions which use Docker for easy deployment.

Please refer to the [**Database Setup Guide**](./alembic/README.md).

## Data Sources

The inventory is built by incorporating data from the following sources:

> [!NOTE]
> Each record in the database is linked to its original source to ensure clear
> data provenance and proper attribution.

We are continuously working on adding more data sources to enhance the
comprehensiveness of the inventory.

## Classifications

The database stores a classification for each event and includes multiple types
of mass-movement phenomena, **not only landslides**. Types present include:

- gravity slide or flow
- rockfall
- mass movement (undefined)
- deepâ€‘seated rock slope deformation
- collapse / sinkhole

See the classification table in the database for the set of types.
