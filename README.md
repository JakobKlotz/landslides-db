# oCoMMA | open Collection of Mass Movements in Austria

This project is dedicated to compiling and sharing **event data on mass 
movements across Austria**. The goal is to provide researchers with accessible 
information to accelerate their work.

By consolidating data from various national and international sources, we 
provide a PostGIS data base that can be easily setup using Docker.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is under active development. The data base schema and its 
> records are subject to change.

> [!TIP]
> For quick access without setting up the data base, a GeoPackage dump is 
> available. It contains a single table of the events and is located in the
> [`db-dump/`](./db-dump/) directory.

## Getting Started

To get your own instance of the data base up and running, please follow the 
setup instructions which use Docker for easy deployment.

Please refer to the [**Quick Start Guide**](https://docs.geohub.at/quick-start.html).

## Help

Documentation is available at [docs.geohub.at](https://docs.geohub.at).

## Data Sources

The inventory is built by incorporating data from the following sources:

> [!NOTE]
> Each record in the data base is linked to its original source to ensure clear
> data provenance and proper attribution.

We are continuously working on adding more data sources to enhance the
comprehensiveness of the inventory.

## Classifications

The data base stores a classification for each event and includes multiple 
types of mass-movement phenomena. Types present are:

- gravity slide or flow
- rockfall
- mass movement (undefined)
- deep‑seated rock slope deformation
- collapse / sinkhole
